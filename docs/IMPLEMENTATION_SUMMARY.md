#### TypeScript Enhancements
**File**: `types/teams.ts`
- Created comprehensive team-related interfaces
- Replaced all `any` types with proper union types
- Fixed TypeScript errors in team statistics components
- Added proper type safety throughout codebase

#### Database Integration
- Leveraged existing Prisma schema relationships
